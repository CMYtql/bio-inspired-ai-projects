Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony and Particle Swarm Optimization projects

I'm not a .NET guy, but I contributed heavily in these projects for an Artificial Intelligence course taken together with the Master's program as a grad student. These involve pretty advanced algorithms in biologically-inspired artificial intelligence.

**Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm** is actually a project with mono-objective and multi-objective genetic algorithm implementations. The multi-objective part includes both NSGA2 and SPEA2 approaches.

**Ant-colony and Particle Swarm Optimization** is a comparison of both methods on the Traveling Salesman Problem.
